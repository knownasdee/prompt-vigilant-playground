# Prompt Playground

Prompt Playground is a simple web app for experimenting with AI-like prompts.  
You can type a prompt, choose a model, and get an instant (mocked) response.  
It’s built with React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and Mantine to demonstrate modern frontend architecture and clean UI design.
